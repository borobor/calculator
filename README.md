# calculator
Calculator project from The Odin Project using HTML, CSS and JS.

# update after finishing:
It's a good first issue! 

Overall happy with the work done.
After checking few other possible solutions on YT my code seems rather noobish, but then again I am a noob so that's fine I guess.
On a positive note, this code is, I believe, very readable and easy to understand and from what I've heard that is a good thing when you're coding along with other people who will read/rewrite your work (which is hopefully my destiny too).
Now I'm eager to switch my attention to backend which is the next chapter on The Odin Project so this will do for now! ttyl
